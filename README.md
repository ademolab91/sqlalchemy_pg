# SQLALCHEMY PLAYGROUND (PG)

This repo contains code snippets from the sqlalchemy tutorial. It's purpose is to serve as a jotting note for me as I learn the technology.

All codes are in the `code.ipynb` file where I have also included explanations for almost every block of code.

This repo is also free to use for anyone seeking to learn `sqlalchemy`. Just clone the repo and run them cell by cell while trying to understand what is going on.
